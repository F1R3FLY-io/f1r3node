# =================================================================
# LOCAL STANDALONE DEVELOPMENT CONFIGURATION
# =================================================================
# This configuration is for LOCAL standalone Rust node development (no Docker).
# Based on: system-integration/conf/standalone-dev.conf
#
# ROLE: Single-node development environment
# - Runs a single validator node with instant finalization
# - Optimized for fast development iteration
# - No network coordination needed (standalone = true)
# - Ceremony master creates genesis block immediately
#
# KEY CHARACTERISTICS:
# - standalone = true (no network, self-contained)
# - fault-tolerance-threshold = 0.0 (instant finalization)
# - Fast intervals (5s casper loop, 60s timeout)
# - dev-mode = true (enables development features)
# - Single pos-multi-sig key (bootstrap wallet)
#
# USAGE: just run-standalone
# DATA DIRECTORY: run-local/data/standalone/

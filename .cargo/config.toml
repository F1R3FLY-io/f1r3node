# Suppress future-incompatibility warnings from dependencies
#
# The hocon = "0.9.0" library (used in the node crate) depends on nom v4.2.3
# and nom v4.2.3 contains code that will be rejected by future Rust versions.
# This generates a warning: "the following packages contain code that will be
# rejected by a future version of Rust".
#
# HOCON is rather weakly supported in the Rust community. We tried using the
# hocon-rs crate to switch to another library and eliminate the warning caused
# by the existing HOCON dependency. However, we found that all four versions
# of hocon-rs (as of January 12, 2026) are built on top of Rust nightly features,
# specifically requiring unstable features such as generic_const_exprs
# (e.g., the error: "using _ for array lengths is unstable", issue #85077).
#
# At this point, after internal discussions within the integration team
# (@spreston8, @YuriiO-DevBrother), we decided to silence this warning to keep
# the project builds clean in scope of next commands (cargo build, cargo test --release),
# and in the future migrate away from HOCON to another format that is well supported
# by the Rust community (JSON, YAML, etc.).
#
# TECHNICAL NOTE:
# Future-incompatibility warnings are shown AFTER compilation completes and cannot
# be suppressed via rustflags. They are informational only and do not affect the build.
# The warning is suppressed using the [future-incompat-report] section below.
